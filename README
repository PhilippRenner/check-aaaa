Program:	check-aaaa: AAAA response checker
Version:	0.3
Author:		Shumon Huque <shuque@upenn.edu>

check-aaaa: A small python program to query a set of DNS names
for the presence of AAAA records via a set of DNS recursive
resolvers.

I wrote this quick program on World IPv6 Launch Day (June 6th 2012),
after I discovered that some websites were selectively delivering
AAAA records to DNS resolvers, based on measurements by those websites
of the quality of IPv6 connectivity from clients using those resolvers.
Running this program periodically against your own resolvers can
alert you to times when they end up on such AAAA blacklists. The
four website names that are preconfigured into this script (google,
facebook, netflix, and bing) have been known to implement such blacklists.

Pre-requisites:

	Python 2.x
	dnspython module (http://www.dnspython.org/)

Configuration:

    * Edit "check-aaaa" to configure your own list of DNS
      recursive resolvers and your own list of DNS names 
      that you want to test. These lists are defined in the
      python lists RESOLVERS and QNAMES.

Installation:

    * System wide (typically /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin), as root:

        python setup.py install

    * In your home directory ($HOME/bin):

        python setup.py install --home=$HOME

    * Or just copy the "check-aaaa" file to wherever you want to put it.

Example (hypothetical) runs:

The following example has no output (and a return code of 0)
indicating that all provided names eliciting AAAA reponses via
all provided recursive resolvers.

  $ check-aaaa

The following example, shows that one of the resolvers (192.0.2.173)
did not get a AAAA response for www.google.com, while another 
(198.51.100.29) did not get a AAAA response for www.netflix.com.

  $ check-aaaa
  resolver1,192.0.2.173 -> www.google.com. not returning AAAA
  resolver2,198.51.100.29 -> www.netflix.com. not returning AAAA
